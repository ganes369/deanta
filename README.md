# Project README

### Project Scope

The goal of this project is to develop a API utilizing PHP and Node.js to handle user management, authentication, and project tracking functionalities. Docker will be used for containerization to ensure smooth deployment across various environments, and MySQL will serve as the database for storing user information, project details, and related data.

### Key Features

1. **User Management:**

   - Create/update user profiles with email and password.
   - Implement secure authentication mechanisms to generate and verify user tokens.

2. **Project Management:**

   - Develop endpoints for creating/updating projects.
   - Enable associations between users and their respective projects.
   - Allow projects to contain multiple articles.

3. **Article Management:**
   - Implement functionality to crud articles within projects.
   - Ensure proper validation and authentication for article operations.

## Conclusion

We believe that with the implementation of these features and comprehensive documentation, our API will provide a solid foundation for managing user authentication and project tracking. If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Let's build something great together! ðŸš€

## Documentation

test the api using a collection that is at the root of this project `Insomnia`

documentation for each resource can be found in the insonmia collection

use phpmyAdminer to view the base data (project_deanta =node/deanta=php)
available at http://localhost:8081/

Clear documentation for each endpoint is crucial for understanding and utilizing the API effectively. The documentation should include:

- **Endpoint URL:** The URL at which the endpoint is accessible.
- **Request Method:** The HTTP method used to interact with the endpoint (e.g., POST, PUT).
- **Request Parameters:** Any parameters required by the endpoint (if applicable).
- **Response Format:** The format of the response returned by the endpoint (e.g., JSON).
- **Authentication Requirements:** Details regarding authentication required to access the endpoint.
- **Sample Request Payload:** Example payload for making requests to the endpoint (if applicable).
- **Sample Response Payload:** Example response payload returned by the endpoint (if applicable).
- **Additional Notes:** Any additional information or considerations relevant to the endpoint.
