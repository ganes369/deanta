# Project README

### Project Scope

The goal of this project is to develop a API utilizing PHP and Node.js to handle user management, authentication, and project tracking functionalities. Docker will be used for containerization to ensure smooth deployment across various environments, and MySQL will serve as the database for storing user information, project details, and related data.

### Key Features

1. **User Management:**

   - Create/update user profiles with email and password.
   - Implement secure authentication mechanisms to generate and verify user tokens.

2. **Project Management:**

   - Develop endpoints for creating/updating projects.
   - Enable associations between users and their respective projects.
   - Allow projects to contain multiple articles.

3. **Article Management:**
   - Implement functionality to crud articles within projects.
   - Ensure proper validation and authentication for article operations.
